\section{Introduction}

My career goals of late, are a bit undefined as I'm not completely sure what I'm aiming to achieve in life. Currently I aspire to run a small indie studio in Paris in which I have as much creative freedom as possible. The main issue with my current goal is that it doesn't require teamwork to succeed but in the long term, it's best for me to develop the required skills to work on games of all shapes and sizes so that I have some flexibility when I'm experienced enough to go into the industry. I have identified five skills to work on over the next semester based on the weekly journals I had written throughout the first semester. They are:

\begin{small}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Punctuality
	\item Planning work with teams
	\item Managing my essays
	\item Using version control
	\item My undefined perfectionism
\end{itemize}
\end{small}

\section{Punctuality}

I'd be lying if I said that I attended as many of the lectures and studio practice sessions that I could. My attendance has been pretty lacklustre throughout the first semester and it had a detrimental effect on my abilities to progress through the course.
\\
There were two main issues that this caused; I fell behind on some of my coursework and it affected my relationship with my COMP150 project team. Not attending all the timetabled programming sessions led to me struggling to complete some of the tasks and forced me into asking peers for assistance when I should have been able to complete the work by myself. It also led to some tensions developing between me and couple of teammates on my game project (though were other factors that could have caused that).
\\
The main reason this happened was largely due to me not having an actual sleep routine or pattern and me ending up demotivated to go to my scheduled sessions. By using SMART principles I feel the best way to fix this issue will be to develop a consistent sleep schedule that extends into weekends as well as weekdays so that it doesn't get disrupted like it did last semester when I would start a schedule and then lose it the moment the weekend begun.

\section{Planning work with teams}

The next issue that I need to tackle is one relating to teamwork, that being when I'm in a team, I need to set reasonable work objectives and goals so that I can make meaningful contributions to the project.
\\
A big issue that was encountered by everyone in my last game project was that we didn't really use our task board that effectively. We each assigned each other tasks that would have been required at different times of the project's lifetime. Unfortunately all my tasks ended up being a bit redundant in the grand scheme of things and if the team and I had set more realistic work tasks I may have been able to make greater contributions to the project.
\\
By using SMART the best approach would be to come up with a timetable for when we would like to finish certain aspects of the game and add them to the final build. With that, we then come up with reasonable goals and tasks that can be accomplished more realisticaly in time for the deadlines we set.

\section{Managing my essays}

Essay management proved to become a real challenge for me, particularly in weeks 7 and 8. I ended up doing pretty much two full essays in the span of a week and a half which left me exhausted and stressed.
\\
The problem with my ultimate approach of purposely leaving one essay to the week before and failing to manage my assignments correctly and leading to me having to do another essay straight after with very little time is that its left me probably not obtaining the best grade I could. I know that some of the categories on the marking rubric such as those on references haven't been fulfilled to the best of my abilities simply because I had no time to fully meet the requirements. The other issue is that it had obviously had a negative effect on my health and lead to me actually falling ill right after the essays were handed in.
\\
This is an issue that can be solved quite simply using SMART principles. I need to start working on essays the moment I receive them and I need to pace myself through the assignment. By doing this, I should be able to manage essays are a lot smoother and more effectively.

\section{Using version control}

One of the issues I didn't anticipate throughout the semester was in relation to a new skill developed during the first half of the semester and that was version control. On quite a few occassions I ended up forgetting to put my work up on github and it led to a few issues arising.
\\
One of the issues that I found with not putting all my work up on github straight away is that it lead to my team thinking that I wasn't doing anything when in actuality I had done my work but had simply left it on my home computer. This led to a couple of tensions rising with a few colleagues and didn't look good for my profesionalism. The other issue is that it lead to some of my work being seperated between github, the studio computers and my own personal home computer which caused some confusion.
\\
The SMART solution would be to upload all my work, even that of which I think is useless, onto guthub so that I have it all available to me at all times.

\section{My undefined perfectionism}

The final issue I'm wishing to tackle is my differing mentality to various aspects of the course.
\\
When it comes to maths quizzes, I have an innate sense that I need to get perfect scores but with essays and worksheets I seem to lose the motivation to achieve perfect scores. This probably spawns from my school days where I did maths challenges and had to compete with peers to get specific opportunities in school. Not only is this a bad mentality to have just generally, but I know I'm capable of achieving good grades in all my modules. Of course wanting to do well in a specific module is good but I need all of them to achieve a respectable degree.
\\
The SMART approach to this would be to give each task enough time so that I can put in the time to get the best grade possible.

\section{Conclusion}

To conclude, I feel that I can reasonably accomplish all five of my skill objectives and that they all contribute to my development as a game developer and an individual. Sorting out my punctuality and essay management is good for both my degree and my working life, being able to plan with teams correctly is good for big projects that require multiple people. Version control is a good skill to master for in general and getting a better mindset towards work is good all round.
