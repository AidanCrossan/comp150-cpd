# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

The first week is over and I feel like I've started to settle down into the university lifestyle a bit. The week started with all the induction talks and meet-ups that were stated on the timetable and they were all quite handy for making sure that I was up-to-date on everything before fully embarking on a degree.

The not so straight-forward part was definitely the Robot Olympiad which completely took me out of my comfort zone. Teamwork has never really been something I'm overly comfortable with and it was particularly challenging to work with people I had never even met before. The robotics aspect as well was completely new to me and I found it pretty hard to contribute anything of value when half my team seemed to have a pretty good handle of what they were doing. I think having done some research after class on Lego robotics may have helped me to actually contribute something to the creation of our robot.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

This week was a bit more easy for me to handle. We had teamwork again in COMP150 but I found it a lot better once we all started to actually have conversations about both the work and our own lives. It appears that everyone is starting to get to know each other now and that its becoming a little easier to talk to the shyer members of our class.

COMP110 was pretty simple for me admittedly. Everything that was covered was a part of the A Level Computer Science curriculum so at worst, I only vaguely knew concepts that were covered before going into the class. COMP120 was pretty similar as well as Python was the language we learnt at school and Pygame is what I used for my coursework so none of it was particularly new. I think my goal for this upcoming week should be to learn all the new terminology that was discussed in COMP150 in relation to business and commerce.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

COMP120 was by far the most challenging aspect of the course this week. It felt like we had a massive jump moving into Pygame, in to territory that I hadn't covered at A Level. With a bit of help from peers and some web browsing, I managed to keep up with the lesson (even if my peer didn't). My goal for next week is to make sure I don't forget anything I learnt from the class and to revise my programs from before I started the course to see if there is any transferable material that can help with the module.

Both COMP110 and COMP120 were fairly straightforward this week again. Agile Philosophy was something I had some familiarity with from A Level and Alan Turing was someone I had researched quite a bit throughout my academic life so I was pretty comfortable with these modules this week.

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

The COMP150 Game Concept Pitch was the big focus for this week. There was quite a bit of excitement and anticipation that could be felt from my coursemates. A lot of people were worried about nerves, which is something that didn't really bother me. I had experience with pitching and giving presentations to far larger audiences than what we had to do for the course. That said, my delivery was a bit all over the place. I knew roughly what I had to say for each of the slides but I realised that a couple of them didn't clearly state what they needed to and it ended up with me sort of rambling at points. It had been a little while since I last presented something and I think it showed, so my constructive criticism for myself this week would be to go over my old presentations and remind myself how to actually present well and not just okay.

Tinkering Graphics was begun this week as well and is going okay. I'm hoping that my peer will start to actually try and not leave me to do everything, particularly as I wouldn't say I'm confident with the subject matter. Version control is another thing I need to go away and practice a bit but should hopefully become pretty easy over time.

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Found out I was working on Pillars this week along with my team. Actually pretty content, it's a mixture of people I sort of know and people I don't, so hopefully I should get along with everyone.

A lot of focus went onto the tinkering graphics assignment this week. I've realised my peer isn't going to help in actually creating a program and I've begun seriously embarking on it solo. I feel moderately confident I can achieve the task's core objectives and I hope that I'll be able to finish it by the deadline.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

I missed the peer-review which was a big mistake. Fortunately I version controlled the program and my peer was able to submit it but it was rather unprofessional and unstudious of me to miss it. Fortunately I was able to submit reviews of the work that was assigned to me. My goal for not only next week but for the rest of the study block will be to be more punctual and to make a greater effort to attend everything.

The lecture on academic writing was rather useful. Even though I had plenty of experience with academic writing from my school days, it had been a while since I had to write a proper essay and writing at a university level is going to be a new challenge.

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

This week was dedicated to studio practice on our group game projects. Unfortunately, even though my goal from last week was to be more punctual, I ended up being ill for a majority of the week and was unable to actually attend most of the meetings my group agreed on. That being said, my group was in disarray for most of the week and there was a real communications issue when it came to everyone meeting up and being at the studio. I did some work in my own time but I made the mistake of not putting it on version control. Definite lesson of the week, is to put everything on version control even if you don't think it'll be useful. 

## Week 7

and so on...

This week was very much dedicated to the agile essay and the agile presentation that I had to do with my COMP150 group. This was quite an interesting week for me in discovering the true breadth of references available on what I thought previously to be quite a niche subject. Learning how to use the Falmouth online library and how to browse the internet for resources proved to be a whole new learning experience in itself and I've found that most of the references I was originally intending to use were either not pedagogical enough or lacked any real valuable content.

## Week 8

and so on...

I learnt this week the importance of staying on top of all your modules as I had a horrible moment of realisation when I discovered that I had forgotten the COMP110 Research Journal. I spent most of the week cobbling together the journal which I think turned out okay but admittedly could have been a lot better if I had put in the time in prior weeks. It was also a harder topic to write about as it required quite in-depth knowledge of a specific topic. I chose to do my research topic on Dijkstra as I had some familiarity with his mathematical concepts and I did some reading into his life prior to coming to university. I found the research journal to be more interesting than I had expected and found it to be a lot more topical than I was expecting. Lesson of the week; make a schedule that includes all of your modules assignments.

## Week 9

and so on...

This week was a bit all over the place as we were nearing the end of both the COMP150 Game Project and the COMP120 Tinkering Audio assignment. For COMP120 I was paired with two other people and found myself not really being included in their plans (not that they appeared to have any) so I decided to focus on contributing my parts into COMP150. Our game wasn't really working properly and up to this point, my contributions to the project would have been pretty redundant. I decided to add in what I could and tried to aid the less experienced programmers (not that I would say I'm experienced) in trying to complete their aspects of the project.

## Week 10

and so on...

We had to present our game from COMP150 this week which ended up being a tad embarrassing but we somehow got through it. I did the part that I was given and I feel that my delivery was a lot sharper this time around compared to earlier weeks.

The other major thing that happened this week is that we were assigned our new groups for the next semester. I'm a little bit more positive about the project as the idea seems a lot more concrete and interesting than what Pillars evolved into and hopefully I'll be able to make a bigger contribution than before.

## Week 11

and so on...

I think this was the most exciting week of the course as we finally started to work on the Unreal engine. A lot of the lesson was build-up and C++ basics which was okay. I've never used an object-oriented programming language before so this is all a bit new to me but I have plenty of time to practice and it's a bit more interesting than Python. The tutorial seems pretty clear and easy to follow as well so my obvious goal for the week is to get through as much of it as I can and to try and cement the C++ fundamentals as best I can.

## Week 12

and so on...

Last week of term, and had the new game project pitch which went pretty well. I contributed a few ideas and feel that I should be a lot more useful to this project.

For me though, this week was about maths. Throughout the semester, I haven't found the maths quizzes to be that difficult and have aimed to 100% every one. However Worksheet D & E have been giving me some issues and its given me this innate sense of perfectionism. My goal is to 100% all five maths tests without fail.
